Just getting started

todo in friend expense page:
1)make the expenses in array instead of object to have it in order  Done
2) allow add expense only if both the friend and your money sums up to total amount Done
3) clear input after expense has been added Done


bugs:
when already a friend is added, it is allowing me to add friend again
