Just getting started

todo in friend expense page:
1)make the expenses in array instead of object to have it in order  Done
2) allow add expense only if both the friend and your money sums up to total amount Done
3) clear input after expense has been added Done 


bugs:
when already a friend is added, it is allowing me to add friend again Done


when split is added 3.3333333333 done

need to reverse the array in group expense done

implement debouncing for every api call : idiotic tester sairam :(

add cumulative settleup in top of the specific group Done

when a user is added in a group it is not immediately reflecting in other components in specific group, this causes split not include the newly added user, where it takes effect only after the second render, needs state lifting  Done
